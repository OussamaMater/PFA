    <h1>Find yourself outside</h1>
    <h4>Hipcamp is everywhere you want to camp. Search, discover and book ranches, farms, vineyards, nature

    <h6>Our mission</h6>
    <h2>Get more people outside</h2>
    <p>Our overall mission is to get more people outside and, more specifically, to inspire the next generation of
        people who are passionate about exploring AND protecting our lands. Spending time outdoors has proven health
        benefits and fosters a deeper connection to the awesome, wild world out there. And we’re firm believers that
        people will only protect what they connect to and care about.</p>
    <p>Getting more people outside really starts with access; access to land, but also to information about that
        land.
        We don't think finding somewhere to camp should be such a time-consuming, convoluted and confusing process,
        which
        is why we started Hipcamp. We are committed to making getting outside fun, easy, and as simple as selecting
        what,
        when and where you want your camping experience to be. Need a campsite by the beach next weekend where you
        can
        bring your dog? We got you!</p>

    <h6>Our Values</h6>
    <h2>Leave it better.</h2>
    From protecting the planet to perfecting our codebase, our work is grounded by the core belief that we can
    always
    improve—as individuals, as a team, as a community, and as a species. Humans can and should have a positive
    impact
    on
    their environment—so we live and breathe this every day.
    <h2>Diversity is strength.</h2>
    The more diverse an ecosystem is—from the the employees in an office to the plants and animals on a farm—the
    better
    equipped it is to survive and thrive, especially during times of change. In prioritizing and protecting
    diversity,
    we’re actively working to build a more equitable, innovative, and resilient world.
    <h2>Practice self-care.</h2>
    Self-care is the foundation of success. We intentionally promote our wellbeing so we can always show up as our
    best
    selves. This approach helps us cultivate a mutually supportive community and create genuinely impactful and
    humane
    work.
    <h2>Hold each other up.</h2>
    The world's tallest trees—the redwoods—intertwine their roots to support each other's growth. We build a
    powerful
    community of support by providing thoughtful feedback, celebrating wins, and investing in each other’s growth.
